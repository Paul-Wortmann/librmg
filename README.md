# librmg
Random Map Generator Library

!Currently only Linux is supported!

Librmg is a procedural dungeon generation library intended for use with 2D tile based maps.
Librmg includes a number of algorithms:

- C1: Cave maps generated using cellular automata.
- C2: Cave maps generated using overlapping circles
- D1: Dungeon maps generated with random rooms and then connected.
- D2: Dungeon maps generated by recursively subdividing the map and then filling the regions with rooms.
- M1: Maze map, including rooms.

- T1: Town map, currently incomplete. (WIP)

Librmg features include:

- Optionally fill generated rooms with prefabricated rooms loaded from file.
- Generated maps consist of 3 layers, base (wall, floor, liquid), object and event layers.
- Maps are tested for connectivity using floodfill and an A* pathfinder.
- Rooms are discovered, numbered and various data is stored for future applications.
